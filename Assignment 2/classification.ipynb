    "   In this section, we aim to solve a classification problem using logistic regression, a baseline model, and another classification model. The problem chosen for this task is [specify if binary or multiclass classification]. We seek to understand which attributes are important for distinguishing between classes and compare the performance of logistic regression with other methods. "
